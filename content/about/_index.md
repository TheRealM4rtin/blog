# About Me

I remember using Windows XP on the CRT screen in the living room of my small flat. Now I'm interested in AI. I want to build and deliver because that's all I need and open-source is what we need.

## Web Presence
  As a GenZ, back in the day, I was creating YouTube content, mainly on Minecraft and Black Ops 2 from 2013 to 2016. For no real reason I launched some websites about high-tech and web culture hype. I kept that vibe going, writing articles from 2017 to 2019. And now, here I am, circling back to that world again.
