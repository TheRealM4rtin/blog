# About Me

I love computers. I remember using windows XP on the cathodic screen in the living room of my little appartment. I'm now interested in AI. I want to build and deliver. That's all I need. Open-source is what we need.

## Web Presence
  As a GenZ, back in the day, I was all about creating YouTube content, mainly on Minecraft and Black Ops 2 from 2013 to 2016. For no real reason, I launched some websites, all about spreading my high-tech and web culture hype. I kept that vibe going, writing articles from 2017 to 2019. And now, here I am, circling back to that world again.
