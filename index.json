[{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m currently working on a research project on LLMs Compression. Making these models smaller and more efficient. This includes techniques like Pruning, Quantization, and Distillation.\nOur work primarily explores three categories of LLM compression techniques: Quantization, knowledge Distillation, and Pruning. Each of these techniques offers a unique approach to reducing the size and computational demands of LLMs.\nQuantization reduces the number of bits required to represent each weight in the model, thus decreasing its overall size. Knowledge Distillation effectively condensing the knowledge by training a smaller model (student) to replicate the performance of a larger one (teacher). Pruning involves removing less important parts of the model to\nmake it more efficient without significant loss in performance. During our research, we gathered over 150 research papers related to state-of-the-art LLMs Compression methods and Optimization. I think this collection is pretty valuable. So here\u0026rsquo;s this massive pile of research for you.\nThe paper will be published mid-2024.\nNote that if you see a green check emoji ✅ next to a paper on the Notion page, it means there\u0026rsquo;s a brief report available for that paper right there on the page.\nRight now, the collection is organized as a Notion webpage that I\u0026rsquo;ve made accessible. I\u0026rsquo;m still considering other platforms like Zotero or GitHub to host this library, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t settled on one yet. If you have any suggestions or preferences, let me know.\nSome themes covered Quantization Pruning Distillation Low-Rank Factorization Compression Finetuning Hyperparameters Encoding Prompt Benchmarks Open Source Models Agents Memory https://therealmartin.notion.site/LLM-Compression-A-state-of-the-art-6a920ba022c54f0ab4e47b0654e7b738?pvs=4\n","permalink":"https://therealm4rtin.github.io/blog/posts/literature-overview/post-sota-llm/","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;m currently working on a research project on LLMs Compression.
